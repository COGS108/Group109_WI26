    "**From Chidiebere- can you include that we are measuring ice enforcement in arrests,detentions, and deportations\n",
    "And the masurement we are using is the is the total number of outcomes per population i.e. the total number of people form country A that were either deported,arrested,or detained,/total number of ice cases** -->\n",
    "\n",
    "ICE is the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or an agency within the Department of Homeland Security responsible for deportation and investigations regarding immigration law violations. After 9/11, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 was established. This act was established to reduce threats by terrorist networks and enforce immigration laws. In the following year, 2003, ICE was created under the Department of Homeland Security. Although ICE was created to enforce immigration laws, it has become very controversial in recent years, as some claim ICE has allegedly over-discriminated certain racial groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, work regarding our research question has been done and public data sets exist that compile ICE arrest and deportation records.<a href=\"#ref1\">1</a> This dataset shows information, including race, on many people ICE has encountered, arrested, detained, transported, deported, and jailed. However, this dataset lacks information about the total amount of immigrants from each country, and just gives raw data about the amount of immigrants that were arrested, etc. from a given country. There has also been research done regarding ICE arrest statistics in major US cities and their different types of arrests. <a href=\"#ref2\">2</a> This source has data on the arrest date, arrest city, country of citizenship, and criminality. However, a drawback to this source is the lack of accessibility of more specific data. There is only broad statistics having to do with ICE arrests in major cities. Furthermore, there is information about individual encounters with ICE enforcement in the final source. <a href=\"#ref3\">3</a> This source gives much more individual detail than the other sources, but still is lacking in terms of real-time updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through analyzing data from these three sources, we can begin to answer how the distribution of ICE arrests by country of citizenship has shifted across 2023, 2024, and 2025, and whether certain countries have become more or less overrepresented over time. Specifically, our group is measuring arrests done by ICE per country of origin of immigrants in the United States. This will be represented by the number of immigrants from a given country that have been arrested divided by the total number of ICE cases in the from the respective year 2023, 2024 and 2025.\n",

    "We hypothesize that the distribution of ICE arrests by country of citizenship will shift noticeably from 2023 to 2025, with some countries making up a growing share of total arrests while others decline. Specifically we expect individuals from Latin American countries to remain consistently overrepresented across all three years, largely due to longstanding enforcement patterns that have historically targeted populations perceived as more likely to lack legal documentation. Furthermore, we expect this overrepresentation to grow over time, driven by the increasing aggressiveness of ICE enforcement in recent years."

This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.

    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> Our data shows arrest, removals, etc. But it does not explain specific reasons behind these actions and we also don't know the experiences of the people affected by this. With that being said we will make sure to make that a point when presenting our results, making the limits clear. \n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> We are aware that some of the data and findings that we use could be mistaken to support harmful narratives. So we will make it clear in our analysis to explain everything to reduce potential risks."
