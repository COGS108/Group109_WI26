    "**From Chidiebere- can you include that we are measuring ice enforcement in arrests,detentions, and deportations\n",
    "And the masurement we are using is the is the total number of outcomes per population i.e. the total number of people form country A that were either deported,arrested,or detained,/total number of ice cases** -->\n",
    "\n",
    "ICE is the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or an agency within the Department of Homeland Security responsible for deportation and investigations regarding immigration law violations. After 9/11, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 was established. This act was established to reduce threats by terrorist networks and enforce immigration laws. In the following year, 2003, ICE was created under the Department of Homeland Security. Although ICE was created to enforce immigration laws, it has become very controversial in recent years, as some claim ICE has allegedly over-discriminated certain racial groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, work regarding our research question has been done and public data sets exist that compile ICE arrest and deportation records.<a href=\"#ref1\">1</a> This dataset shows information, including race, on many people ICE has encountered, arrested, detained, transported, deported, and jailed. However, this dataset lacks information about the total amount of immigrants from each country, and just gives raw data about the amount of immigrants that were arrested, etc. from a given country. There has also been research done regarding ICE arrest statistics in major US cities and their different types of arrests. <a href=\"#ref2\">2</a> This source has data on the arrest date, arrest city, country of citizenship, and criminality. However, a drawback to this source is the lack of accessibility of more specific data. There is only broad statistics having to do with ICE arrests in major cities. Furthermore, there is information about individual encounters with ICE enforcement in the final source. <a href=\"#ref3\">3</a> This source gives much more individual detail than the other sources, but still is lacking in terms of real-time updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through analyzing data from these three sources, we can begin to answer how the distribution of ICE arrests by country of citizenship has shifted across 2023, 2024, and 2025, and whether certain countries have become more or less overrepresented over time. Specifically, our group is measuring arrests done by ICE per country of origin of immigrants in the United States. This will be represented by the number of immigrants from a given country that have been arrested divided by the total number of ICE cases in the from the respective year 2023, 2024 and 2025.\n",

    "We hypothesize that the distribution of ICE arrests by country of citizenship will shift noticeably from 2023 to 2025, with some countries making up a growing share of total arrests while others decline. Specifically we expect individuals from Latin American countries to remain consistently overrepresented across all three years, largely due to longstanding enforcement patterns that have historically targeted populations perceived as more likely to lack legal documentation. Furthermore, we expect this overrepresentation to grow over time, driven by the increasing aggressiveness of ICE enforcement in recent years."

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

Several columns are missing in structured, co-occurring groups that reflect real-world case outcomes, for example, departure information is absent for cases with no recorded departure, and case disposition fields are jointly missing for cases that never reached final processing. This suggests the data is primarily missing at random or missing not at random, and imputation alone would not be appropriate without domain-driven reasoning about what missingness represents."

Inspecting both issues together confirmed they occur on the same row, meaning a single record accounts for all data quality concerns across these three columns."

Columns related to case outcomes, departure, and geographic processing were excluded entirely since our analysis only measures arrest counts by country and year. Rows missing a unique_identifier were dropped entirely, as they could not be reliably distinguished from one another across the two datasets — retaining them risked either double-counting or incorrectly matching unrelated records when merging. The single row missing citizenship_country was also dropped, leaving a clean dataset of uniquely identifiable arrest records."

    "2A: Data Description and Core Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains individual-level ICE removal records spanning 2011 through 2023. Each row represents a single removal case, and each column corresponds to an administrative attribute of that enforcement action. For the purposes of our analysis, we focus specifically on two core variables: Apprehension Date and Country of Citizenship, which allow us to construct annual distributions of removals by nationality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apprehension Date (date/timestamp format):\n",
    "This variable records the date on which the enforcement action was recorded. The unit of measurement is calendar time at the day level. For analytical purposes, we extract the year from this variable to aggregate removals by calendar year and enable longitudinal comparisons across 2011–2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Country of Citizenship (categorical variable):\n",
    "This variable identifies the nationality of the individual removed. It is central to our research question, as we calculate the proportion of total removals attributable to each country in a given year.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Removal Count (derived metric):\n",
    "Although the dataset does not explicitly provide aggregate totals, each row represents one removal event. Therefore, the count of rows corresponds to the total number of removals. These counts are obtained through grouping operations and are subsequently converted into proportions (measured as shares or percentages of total annual removals).\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Outcome of Interest: is the proportional composition of removals by country within each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because overall enforcement volume fluctuates across years, we focus on proportions rather than raw counts. For example, if 30% of removals in a given year involve individuals from a specific country, this indicates that nearly one-third of enforcement outcomes that year were associated with that nationality. This proportional approach allows us to compare enforcement composition over time even when total removals increase or decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "2B: Data Limitations and Methodological Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several important concerns to acknowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structural incompatibility with arrest data:\n",
    "The 2011 arrest records cannot be reliably joined with the 2011 removal records due to differences in identifiers and data structure. To avoid introducing matching errors, we rely exclusively on the removals dataset for the 2011–2023 historical period.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Policy-driven variation:\n",
    "ICE enforcement priorities shifted across administrations between 2011 and 2023. As a result, observed changes in removal proportions may reflect policy changes rather than underlying migration flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Administrative data bias:\n",
    "This dataset captures enforcement outcomes, not the total undocumented population. It measures government enforcement activity rather than population-level prevalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Missing administrative identifiers:\n",
    "Some internal identifiers contain missing values. However, because our analysis depends primarily on apprehension date and country of citizenship, this missingness does not materially affect our proportional calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scope limitation:\n",
    "The dataset includes only individuals who were formally removed. It excludes those apprehended but released, voluntarily departed, or never encountered by enforcement authorities. Therefore, the data reflect enforcement outcomes rather than the broader undocumented population. Findings should be interpreted as changes in enforcement composition rather than changes in total immigrant presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship to Dataset #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset #2 provides the historical baseline (2011–2023), while Dataset #1 extends the timeline into 2023–2025. To construct a continuous time series, we harmonize the shared variables (apprehension date and country of citizenship) and append the relevant 2023 records from Dataset #2 to Dataset #1. This produces a unified dataset spanning 2011–2025 for proportional analysis."

    "Below shows how many values are missing in the dataset, and from which columns, when totaled it comes out to 1650778.Missingness in this dataset is neither random nor uniform. It clusters into structured groups that reflect real-world case characteristics rather than data quality problems. The most striking pattern is the MSC criminal charge block, where MSC Charge, MSC Charge Code, MSC Conviction Date, MSC Criminal Charge Status, and Case Threat Level are all missing for roughly 153,800 records. These fields are absent because the individual has no criminal charge on record, making that it is missing not at random.Something similar explains why Birth Date is missing for over 437,000 records while Birth Year is almost fully complete. The system appears to have routinely recorded year of birth but not the full date, so this is a collection limitation rather than an error.Fields like Entry Date and Final Order Date are missing for a large chunk of records too, probably because those events never happened for those cases.A handful of fields like Alien File Number and Anonymized Identifier go missing together in the same rows, suggesting a specific batch of records was never fully processed. And a few fields are only missing once, which at this scale is negligible and is probably all the same row."

Columns related to case outcomes, departure, and geographic processing were excluded entirely since our analysis only measures arrest counts by country and year. Rows missing an Anonymized Identifier were dropped entirely, as they could not be reliably distinguished from one another across the two datasets, retaining them risked either double-counting or incorrectly matching unrelated records when merging. The remaining duplicate rows identified during outlier detection were also dropped, keeping the first occurrence of each record to preserve arrest counts as accurately as possible. The single row missing Citizenship Country was also dropped, leaving a clean dataset of uniquely identifiable arrest records. Finally, Apprehension Date was converted to date-only format, dropping the time component, and all retained columns were renamed to match the conventions used in the first dataset, both steps taken to ensure consistency across the two sources before merging."

To ensure a more complete picture, we concatenated it with the ICE 2011–2023 Removals Dataset. After cleaning, both datasets share the same column names and structure, making pd.concat a straightforward way to combine all observations into a single unified dataset."

    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",

    "> We have considered that the data we are using specifically from the ICE website would reflect what they specifically chose to focus on and on certain policies that have changed. We are aware that the data would be based on ICE enforcement instead of the people themselves.  \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",

    "> Our data set does not include any names or personal information on individuals, we are not trying to figure out who they are. \n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "> We are aware that Immigration is a heavy topic especially in the state of the world we are in right now, we will be careful to present the results of our data in a respectful way that doesnt shift blame or target certain groups. Making sure we focus on certain enforcement patterns instead of the individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The data we are using is public and does not include any personal information of individuals. Our data would be safely secured in datahub and github for this project.\n",

    "> The data we have considered that it might have missing data or uneven reportings across different countries, since the data reflects enforcement activity instead of certain behaviors conducted. We will avoid making causal claims and just observing the patterns we see within the data.  \n",

    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will make sure to make graphs and summaries that accurately represent the data we used, avoiding any skewed data.\n",

    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",

    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> Our data shows arrest, removals, etc. But it does not explain specific reasons behind these actions and we also don't know the experiences of the people affected by this. With that being said we will make sure to make that a point when presenting our results, making the limits clear. \n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> We are aware that some of the data and findings that we use could be mistaken to support harmful narratives. So we will make it clear in our analysis to explain everything to reduce potential risks."

    "For our COGS 108 project examining whether ICE arrest activity has differed by country of citizenship over the last two years (2023 - 2025), we agree to work as a collaborative, respectful, and accountable team. Given the sensitivity of immigration-related data and the interdisciplinary nature of this topic, we recognize the importance of clear communication, shared responsibility, and mutual respect throughout the quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication \n",
    "We will primarily communicate through Messenger with the expectation that messages will be acknowledged within 24 hours. We will schedule weekly meetings (remote, as agreed upon) to review progress, assign tasks and discuss challenges. If a team member anticipates being unavailable or delayed, they will notify the group as soon as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tone and Respect\n",
    "We commit to maintaining a professional, respectful, and constructive tone in all interactions. We agree to be honest and direct while remaining polite. Given that this project involves topics related to immigration and enforcement, we will be especially mindful to discuss findings analytically and respectfully, separating personal opinions from data-driven conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision-Making\n",
    "Whenever possible, decisions will be made by consensus. If consensus cannot be reached in a reasonable timeframe, we will use a majority vote. For time-sensitive decisions (e.g., minor coding or formatting choices), the team member responsible for that section may proceed and update the group afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task Distribution and Accountability\n",
    "Work will be divided equitably based on individual strengths (e.g., data wrangling, analysis, visualization, writing), while ensuring that every member contributes to all major aspects of the project: data selection, analysis, code development, interpretation, and writing. Tasks and deadlines will be tracked using a shared task board or document (e.g., GitHub Issues, Google Docs). No single team member is expected to carry a disproportionate share of the workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supporting One Another\n",
    "If a team member is struggling with an assigned task, they are expected to communicate this early so the team can redistribute work or provide support. We agree to approach these situations with understanding and problem-solving rather than blame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conflict Resolution\n",
    "If conflicts arise, we will address them directly, respectfully, and privately as a group before escalating. We will assume good intentions and focus on resolving issues in a way that supports both the project’s success and the well-being of the team. If serious issues persist, we understand that reaching out to course staff is an appropriate step, in line with course policy.\n",
