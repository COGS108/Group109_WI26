    "ICE is the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or an agency within the Department of Homeland Security responsible for deportation and investigations regarding immigration law violations. After 9/11, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 was established. This act was established to reduce threats by terrorist networks and enforce immigration laws. In the following year, 2003, ICE was created under the Department of Homeland Security. Although ICE was created to enforce immigration laws, it has become very controversial in recent years, as some claim ICE has allegedly over-discriminated certain racial groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, work regarding our research question has been done and public data sets exist that compile ICE arrest and deportation records.<a href=\"#ref1\">1</a> This dataset shows information, including race, on many people ICE has encountered, arrested, detained, transported, deported, and jailed. However, this dataset lacks information about the total amount of immigrants from each country, and just gives raw data about the amount of immigrants that were arrested, etc. from a given country. There has also been research done regarding ICE arrest statistics in major US cities and their different types of arrests. <a href=\"#ref2\">2</a> This source has data on the arrest date, arrest city, country of citizenship, and criminality. However, a drawback to this source is the lack of accessibility of more specific data. There is only broad statistics having to do with ICE arrests in major cities. Furthermore, there is information about individual encounters with ICE enforcement in the final source. <a href=\"#ref3\">3</a> This source gives much more individual detail than the other sources, but still is lacking in terms of real-time updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through analyzing data from these three sources, we can begin to answer whether country of citizenship affects ICE enforcement rates, and if so, the degree at which it does so. Specifically, our group is measuring arrests, detentions, and deportations done by ICE per country of origin of immigrants in the United States. This will be represented by the number of immigrants from a given country that have been deported, arrested, or detained divided by the total number of ICE cases with immigrants from the given country.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
